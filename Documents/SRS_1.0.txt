1. Introduction 

1.1 Problem Statement
The security gate of properties having high number of traffic flow face the issue of not being able keep the track of the people coming and going. 
The present system consists of making people write entries in the register. This a very crumblsome process because be not only have to write our general details
but also the in time and out time which require us to comform time through a clock. This whole procedure takes time which will create ccongestion in high density area.
To address this issue, a software solution is needed that can scan the face of the individual at the security gate and create an entry automatically.
The software should be fast, accurate, and able to handle a large volume of visitors at peak times. Additionally, the software should be able to
integrate with the existing security system and ensure the privacy and security of the personal data collected during the facial recognition process. 
The aim of the software is to streamline the security process, reduce waiting times, and enhance the overall security of the facility.

1.2 Objective
1.2.1 Develop a facial recognition software solution that is accurate and reliable in identifying individuals entering the premises.
1.2.2 Integrate the facial recognition software with the existing security system to provide a seamless and efficient security process.
1.2.3 Ensure the privacy and security of personal data collected during the facial recognition process, in compliance with relevant data protection regulations.

1.3 Scope of project
Face Detection System is a program that combines various tools and methods to create a better management system for entries of hostilites(Hostel Students).
This program will be used in the following cases
Necessary images and information will be taken by Admin for face detection at the time of registering to the hostel.
These images and information will be stored in a database fully accessed by Admin and partially accessed by developers
At the time of the entry of a student, Admin will scan the face to mark the entry as in/out.
The program will also Give a list of students that are out after curfew.
Security guards and Hostel Warden as Admin and Hostilites (Hostel Students) are expected users that will engage with the system.
